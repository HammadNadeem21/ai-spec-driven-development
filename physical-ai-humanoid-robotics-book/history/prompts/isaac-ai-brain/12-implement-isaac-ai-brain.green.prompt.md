## User Input

```text
now you can implement the module 3 and chapters in the frotend_book folder thre is already module 2 and module 1 content
```

## Response

Successfully implemented Module 3 (AI-Robot Brain - NVIDIA Isaac™) in Docusaurus documentation system. Created three comprehensive chapters covering Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2 for humanoid robots with simulation-first approach and ROS 2 integration examples. All content properly integrated with navigation in sidebar.

## Outcome

Module 3 fully implemented with three detailed chapters:
- Chapter 1: Isaac Sim for Perception & Data with synthetic data generation
- Chapter 2: Isaac ROS with GPU-accelerated perception and sensor fusion
- Chapter 3: Nav2 for Humanoids with behavior trees and bipedal navigation
All content follows simulation-first methodology with practical examples and ROS 2 integration. Module properly added to sidebar navigation.

## Evaluation

Implementation meets all requirements: comprehensive educational content, simulation-first approach, ROS 2 integration examples, proper Docusaurus structure, and consistent formatting. All content maintains technical accuracy and educational value for advanced AI/robotics students. Module successfully integrated into existing documentation structure.
