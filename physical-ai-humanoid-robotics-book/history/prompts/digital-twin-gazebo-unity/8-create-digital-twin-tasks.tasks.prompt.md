## User Input


## Response

Generated comprehensive task breakdown for Digital Twin Module implementation following user story prioritization from spec. Created 45 tasks organized in 6 phases: Setup, Foundational, User Story 1 (Physics Simulation), User Story 2 (Unity Visualization), User Story 3 (Sensor Simulation), and Polish phase. All tasks follow checklist format with proper IDs, parallel markers, and story labels.

## Outcome

Successfully created detailed task list with 45 implementation tasks organized by user stories. Tasks include documentation creation, Docusaurus integration, content development for all three chapters, and cross-cutting concerns. Each user story is independently testable and follows MVP-first delivery approach.

## Evaluation

Task breakdown meets constitutional requirements: specification-first organization, technical accuracy, clarity for developers, end-to-end integrity, reproducible implementation, and quality constraints. All tasks follow required format with checkboxes, IDs, and proper file paths. Parallel execution opportunities identified.
