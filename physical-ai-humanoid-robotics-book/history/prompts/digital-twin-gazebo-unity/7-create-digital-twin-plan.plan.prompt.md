## User Input

Add Module 2 structure to Docusaurus and create three chapter files as Markdown (.md). Teach Gazebo physics simulation, Unity visualization, and sensor simulation using simulation-first examples integrated with ROS 2.

## Response

Created comprehensive implementation plan for Digital Twin Module including technical context, project structure, research findings, data model, and quickstart guide. The plan covers Docusaurus integration, Gazebo-Unity-ROS2 workflow, and all necessary components for simulation-first development approach.

## Outcome

Successfully created complete implementation plan with technical specifications, research on Gazebo/Unity integration patterns, data model for digital twin components, and setup guide. All constitutional checks passed and the plan is ready for task generation.

## Evaluation

Plan meets constitutional requirements: specification-first development, technical accuracy from official sources, clarity for advanced developers, end-to-end system integrity, reproducible development, and quality constraints. Architecture decision record created for Gazebo-Unity bridge approach.
