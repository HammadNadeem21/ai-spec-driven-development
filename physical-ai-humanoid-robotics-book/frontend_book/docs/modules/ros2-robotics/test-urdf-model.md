# Test: URDF Model Validation

## Purpose
This document serves as a validation checklist to verify understanding of URDF modeling after completing Chapter 3.

## Validation Checklist

After completing Chapter 3: Humanoid Modeling with URDF, verify that you can:

- [ ] Explain the purpose and structure of URDF
- [ ] Create valid URDF models with proper XML syntax
- [ ] Define links with visual, collision, and inertial properties
- [ ] Define joints with appropriate types and limits
- [ ] Set up coordinate frames correctly
- [ ] Validate URDF models using ROS 2 tools
- [ ] Integrate URDF models with ROS 2 and simulators
- [ ] Troubleshoot common URDF errors

## Practical Exercise

Complete the following practical exercise to validate your understanding:

1. Create a simple humanoid robot URDF model with at least 5 links and 4 joints
2. Define visual and collision properties for each link
3. Set appropriate joint limits and types (revolute, continuous, etc.)
4. Validate the URDF model using `check_urdf` command
5. Load the model into RViz to visualize the robot
6. Test the model in a simulation environment

## Expected Outcome

After completing this validation, you should be able to successfully create a valid URDF model that integrates properly with ROS 2 and functions in simulation environments, demonstrating understanding of robot modeling concepts covered in Chapter 3.
