# Test: Python AI Agent Functionality

## Purpose
This document serves as a validation checklist to verify understanding of Python AI agents with rclpy after completing Chapter 2.

## Validation Checklist

After completing Chapter 2: Python AI Agents with rclpy, verify that you can:

- [ ] Explain the rclpy execution and messaging model
- [ ] Create an intelligent control node using Python and rclpy
- [ ] Process sensor data received through ROS 2 topics
- [ ] Send commands to robot controllers via ROS 2 messaging
- [ ] Bridge AI logic to robot controllers effectively
- [ ] Implement proper error handling in AI agents
- [ ] Understand the lifecycle of a Python-based ROS 2 node
- [ ] Debug common issues in Python ROS 2 applications

## Practical Exercise

Complete the following practical exercise to validate your understanding:

1. Create a Python AI agent that subscribes to sensor data (e.g., laser scan or camera feed)
2. Implement basic AI logic to process the sensor data (e.g., obstacle detection)
3. Send commands to robot controllers based on the AI decisions
4. Test the agent with a simulated robot environment
5. Verify that the AI agent responds appropriately to different sensor inputs

## Expected Outcome

After completing this validation, you should be able to successfully build a functional Python AI agent that controls a simulated robot through ROS 2 messaging, demonstrating the integration of AI logic with robot control systems.
